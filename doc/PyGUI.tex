    \section{What is PyGUI?}
    PyGUI is a GUI library powered by \href{https://www.pygame.org/}{pygame}. PyGUI provides
    standard GUI elements which is drawn as pygame surfaces on a pygame window. The goal of this library
    is to provide a way to create a GUI app with pygame in a simple manner. PyGUI handles all the drawing,
    placings and event propagation on the pygame window. Custom elements can be created as classes that
    implement the render\_element interface. The programmer can alter the drawing algorithms or use the 
    simple implemented drawing algorithm(Painter's Algorithm).

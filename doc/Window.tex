    \section{Window Class}
    \subsection{Description}
    The window class represents a window application. It is powered by \href{https://www.pygame.org/}{pygame}. The window has a tree of window elements which
    it uses to render the window elements each frame. The tree is traversed with each element receiving
    events occuring and are tagged to be rerendered when their state has changed.
    \subsection{Class fields}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.5\textwidth}|}
        \hline
        Field name & Type & Description\\
        \hline
        width & int & Defines the width of the window in pixels\\
        \hline
        height & int & Defines the height of the window in pixels\\
        \hline
        windowtitle & str & The title of the window(show in the bar)\\
        \hline
        event\_loop & function & Event loop of the window application. If not specified differently just calls render on its window elements.\\
        \hline
        screen & surface object & Surface object(PyGame object) which window elements are drawn on\\
        \hline
        window\_elements & window\_element& Tree of window elements which is traversed whenever the new frame starts.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \subsection{Class methods}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.5\textwidth}|}
        \hline
        Method name & Parameters & Description\\
        \hline
        \_\_init\_\_ &  & Initializes the class and pygame\\
        \hline
        \_\_str\_\_ & &String representation of the window class object\\
        \hline
        \_\_repr\_\_ & & String representation of the window class object in iterable objects\\
        \hline
        run & & Runs the event loop of the application.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \section{Window elements}
    \subsection{Description}

    method and an event handler, the event handler is called whenever a frame is done and a new frame is starting to be drawn.
